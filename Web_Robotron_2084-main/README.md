Shoot the enemies and rescue the humans to rack as many points as you can!\
At every 25,000 points you get an extra life (indicated next to the score)\
Clear the screen of vulnerable enemies to advance to the next wave

Destroying enemies grants you points but getting too close will cost you a life!
